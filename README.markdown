# ISS Notify Hardware

ISS Notify is an open hardware project to make a desktop notification lamp
specifically for overhead passes for the International Space Station for a
users location.

ISS Notify is a simple 2 layer board with an AVR chip and a set of RGB LEDs
controlled by 16 channel LED driver/shift register chips. It also has a 
real time clock and a LiPo batter charging circuit.

This repo has all of the design files needed for producing the hardware.
